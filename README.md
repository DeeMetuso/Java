# Java
This repository will document my learnings and projects using Java programming language

What is Java?
Java, is a versatile programming language characterized by its class-based and object-oriented nature. 
It aims to minimize implementation dependencies, promoting the concept of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), allowing compiled Java code to execute on various platforms without the necessity for recompilation.
It was initially released in 1991, Java became part of Oracle Corporation. 
its recognised for simplicity, Java is widely used for constructing modular programs and facilitating code reusability. Oracle reports that Java is operational on over 3 billion devices.

Activity 1: List the advantages and disadvantages of Java
Java has the following advantages and disadvantages:

Platform Independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere):

Java programs can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent. 
The "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle allows developers to write code on one platform and execute it on any other platform with a compatible JVM.
Example: A Java application developed on a Windows machine can run on Linux or macOS without modification.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Support:
Java is designed with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming principles. 
It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which promotes code reusability, maintainability, and modularity.
Example: Creating classes and objects, using inheritance to model relationships between classes.

Rich Standard Library:
It has a comprehensive standard library (Java API) that provides a wide range of pre-built functionalities. 
This eliminates the need for developers to write code from scratch for common tasks, saving time and effort.
Example: Java's standard library includes packages for networking, file I/O, data structures, and more.
Strong Community and Ecosystem:

It has a large and active community of developers, which means there is a wealth of resources, libraries, and frameworks available. 
This community support can be valuable for problem-solving, learning, and staying updated on best practices.
Example: The availability of open-source frameworks like Spring for enterprise applications.

Disadvantages:
Memory Consumption:
Java applications can be memory-intensive compared to languages with more direct memory control, which may impact the performance of resource-constrained devices.

Slower Execution Speed:
Java programs can still be slower in terms of execution speed compared to languages that are closer to the hardware, like C or C++.
Example: Real-time systems where microseconds matter.

Verbosity and Boilerplate Code:

ava code can be verbose, requiring more lines of code to perform certain tasks compared to some modern languages. 
This verbosity can make the code harder to read and maintain.
Example: The need for getters and setters for simple classes.
Limited Low-Level System Interaction:

Java is designed to be platform-independent and, therefore, limits direct interaction with low-level system resources. 
This can be a disadvantage in certain system-level programming scenarios.
Example: Direct hardware interaction, kernel-level programming.

// Java Components

In the process of executing a Java program, the initial step involves writing the program in Java code, which is saved in a file with .java extension. 
Next, the Javac compiler comes into play, compiling the Java source code files (.java) into bytecode. This bytecode, the output of the compiler, is stored in a class file. 
Bytecode refers to the intermediary code generated by the compiler. The execution phase is handled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), whose main function is to execute the compiled bytecode. 
Often referred to as JVM, it ensures platform independence by producing the same output across different operating systems. 
The execution of a Java program follows a sequential order: writing the program by the programmer, compilation by the javac compiler, and finally, execution by the JVM during the program run phase.

// Java has the these main features which make it very popular

Platform independence -- One of Java's most significant features is platform independence. Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Object-oriented programming (OOP) -- It emphasizes the organization of code into modular units called objects, promoting concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Simple -- Its straightforward and easy to learn. Its syntax is similar to other C-based languages, making it accessible for developers with prior programming experience.
Robust language -- It is very ability to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. The language incorporates features like strong memory management, automatic garbage collection, and a comprehensive exception-handling mechanism. These aspects contribute to the reliability and stability of Java programs.
Secure --  The language includes various built-in security features, such as the sandboxing of applets and the absence of explicit pointer arithmetic. Java applications run within a secure environment provided by the JVM, minimizing the risk of malicious activities.
Multithreading -- Java supports multithreading, enabling the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program. 
Multithreading is crucial for developing efficient, responsive, and scalable applications, allowing tasks to be executed concurrently, thereby enhancing performance

// Writing Hello World in Java

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args){
    String greeting = "Hello World"; // stores the Hello World into variable greeting
    System.out.println(greeting);
}
}

Output:
Hello World

// Typical structure of a Java program
A Java program usually has the following structure:
Package declaration:
In package declaration specifies the directory or package in which a class is located. 
The keyword "package" is used in this declaration. Import statements are employed to bring in classes from other folders or packages within a Java project, allowing the incorporation of external classes into a program.
Import statements:
The "import" keyword is utilized for import statements. 

Comments:
Comments serve to provide information about variables, methods, classes, or statements in Java. 
Single-line comments are denoted by double forward slashes (//), while multiline comments use /* */. 

Class definition:
The class definition in Java involves assigning a name to a class within a Java file, essential for creating objects and referencing them in other classes or programs. 
The "class" keyword is integral to class definition. The execution of a Java application commences from the main method, serving as the entry point during runtime. 

Methods or behaviours:
These are sets of instructions encapsulated to perform a specific function. They prevent code repetition by allowing the reuse of the same instructions when the same functionality is needed. 
Variable values can be passed to methods to leverage their behaviors.

Activity: Create a class called Dog with two methods bark() and main()

public class Dog {

    // This is the bark method
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }

    // The static main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the Dog class
        Dog myDog = new Dog();

        // Call the bark method
        myDog.bark();
    }
}
